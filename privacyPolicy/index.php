                <h3>What Information Do I Collect?</h3>
                I only collect the information that is essential to maintaining the live leaderboard.
                This information consists of your email, nickname, and highest statistics (length, score, and combo).
                Nothing else is stored in the databases I maintain.
                Your email is acquired using the Google account that you use to log in.
                There currently isn't any way of changing your email or transferring your data to another account.
                You set your nickname when you first log in.
                There currently isn't any way of changing your nickname.
                The only way to alter your in game statistics is to achieve better statistics.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>How do I use the information?</h3>
                The information I collect is used for the sole purpose of recognizing your account and saving your scores.
                All information is stored and automatically indexed on a MongoDB database.
                No additional processing is done on the data.
                The information is stored indefinitely on the database, unless a direct removal is requested by a user through email.

                <h3>What information do I share?</h3>
                None of the information I collect is shared with any third-party.
                The only parties who can access the information is me, mLab (the service hosting the database), and Heroku (the service hosting the nodejs server).
